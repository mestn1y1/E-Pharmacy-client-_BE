Ð•-pharmacy Backend

This backend powers the API for the e-pharmacy platform. It is developed using modern technologies and ensures stable and secure communication between the client application and the database.

To test the API, you can use Swagger UI, accessible at: [SwaggerDocs](e-pharmacy-client-be.onrender.com/api-docs). There you will find a description of all available endpoints, and you can send requests and view server responses.
